# FAIR metadata resource shapes

[SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) shapes for [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) (version 2) resources, with custom additions for FAIR Data Point metadata.

A separate [DASH](https://datashapes.org/) enriched file with UI hints for form generation exists in parallel to the 'structural' core shapes.
